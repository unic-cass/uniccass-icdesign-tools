## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the UNIC-CASS IC Design Tools project, please report it as soon as possible.

- **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security-related matters.
- Instead, please email the maintainers at [add your security contact email here] or use the private contact option on GitHub if available.
- Provide as much information as possible to help us understand and address the issue quickly (e.g., steps to reproduce, affected components, environment).

We will respond to your report promptly and keep you updated on the progress. Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will coordinate a responsible disclosure.

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe!
