The UNIC-CASS IC Design Tools repository provides a comprehensive, open-source suite of tools for Integrated Circuit (IC) design, simulation, and verification. This project is part of the Universalization of IC Design from CASS (UNIC-CASS) programâ€”a structured, end-to-end IC design-to-test experiential learning initiative.

We welcome contributions from the global IC design community!

|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ngspice      | SPICE analog and mixed-signal simulator             |
| xschem       | Schematic Editor                                    |
| magic        | Layout editor with DRC/Extraction capabilities      |
| klayout      | Layout viewer and editor for GDS                    |
| netgen       | Netlist Comparison                                  |
| cvc          | Circuit validity checker                            |
| cace         | Circuit Characterization engine                     |
| gdsfactory   | Python module for GDS generation                    |
| glayout      | Python module for PDK-agnostic layout automation    |
| pygmid       | Python module for systematic circuit sizing         |
| openvaf      | Verilog-A to OSDI compiler                          |

The image also contains the `sky130A`, `gf180mcuD`, and `ihp-sg13g2` PDKs. To change between PDKs, use the `set_pdk` command, e.g., `set_pdk sky130A`. The IHP PDK requires the compilation of OSDI files, which is performed when starting a bash terminal. If the compilation fails, simply open another bash terminal.

Versions and commit references for all tools and PDKs are specified in the `Dockerfile`.
